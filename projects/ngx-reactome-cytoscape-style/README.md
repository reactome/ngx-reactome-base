# Reactome Cytoscape Style

## Usage

To use reactome-cytoscape-style, use the following:

```typescript
import {Reactome} from "reactome-cytoscape-style";

const container: HTMLElement = document.querySelector('#cytoscape-container');
const reactome = new Reactome.Style(container);
const cy = cytoscape({
  ...,
  container: container,
  style: reactome.getStyleSheet()
})

reactome.bindToCytoscape(cy) // Enables style interactivity
```

### Types

In order to use the reactome-cytoscape-style, you need to type your nodes and edges correctly, so that we can style them accordingly.

```typescript
const element: cytoscape.ElementDefinition = {
  data: {
    id: 'ID', // string, unique among all elements
    height: 100, // number, for nodes
    width: 100, // number, for nodes
    displayName: "NODE LABEL", // string, for nodes
    stoichiometry: 1, // number, for edges
    parent: 'COMPARTMENT ID' // string, for nodes | If present, will place the node withing the identified compartment 
  },
  position: {x: 0, y: 0}, // for nodes, if required to be placed manually
  classes: ['Type', 'Family Type'] // Values found in tables bellow
}
```

To do so, whee defining your nodes and edges, apply to them the classes that you will find in the table bellow

#### 1. Nodes

The first thing to notice is that the output network needs to be [bipartite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph).  
Indeed, both `reaction` and  `PhysicalEntity` (interacting molecules) are represented by nodes.
In principle, you should always have a `reaction` between every 2 `PhysicalEnity` nodes.

##### 1.a PhysicalEntity

### Properties

Reactome Cytoscape Style defines several properties that allow you to customize it and define strong and switchable color themes (e.g. dark-them and light-theme)

Here is a table summarizing how to access and customize all those properties.

> All of the JavaScript defined properties accept either a direct value or a function that gives that value

#### Update by JS properties

In order to customise your style, you can provide to the `Reactome.Style()` constructor a property object, of type `Reactome.UserProperties`, where you can define the properties that you want to customize. The values can either be a direct value, or a function that provide the required value type

```typescript
import {Reactome} from "reactome-cytoscape-style";

const container: HTMLElement = document.querySelector('#cytoscape-container');
const properties: Reactome.UserProperties = {};
const style = new Reactome.Style(container, properties);

const cy = cytoscape({
  ...,
  container: container,
  style: style.getStyleSheet()
})

function updateJsProperty() {
  // Updating initial properties object will update style values
  properties.group.key = newValue;
  // Needed to apply the changes
  style.update(cy);
}
```

Updating the `Reactome.UserProperties` you used to initialize the `Reactome.Style`, here `style`, will automatically update the inner state of the style.
You simply need to force an update on the style afterwards so that the new values are taken into account

#### Update by CSS properties

Another way to customise the reactome-cytoscape-style is though the usage of css variables.  
We are using the values as they can be found on the cytoscape container you provided to the `Reactome.Style()` constructor.
This means that you can define your variables either directly on the container, or within one of its parent in the DOM.

That is specifically useful when you have defined a light and a dark theme.  
However, as it is the case when updating the style though Js properties, you also need to trigger an update on the style after the properties have changed so that the change can be taken into account.

```typescript
import {Reactome} from "reactome-cytoscape-style";

const container: HTMLElement = document.querySelector('#cytoscape-container');
const style = new Reactome.Style(container);

const cy = cytoscape({
  ...,
  container: container,
  style: style.getStyleSheet()
})

function updateCssProperty(property: string, newValue: string) {
  // Updating Reactome.Style.css is updating the CSS variable on the container element 
  // in order to mimic a css variable change
  Reactome.Style.css.setProperty('--property', newValue);
  // Needed to apply the changes
  style.update(cy);
}
```

## Developers

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project reactome-cytoscape-style` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project reactome-cytoscape-style`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project reactome-cytoscape-style` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

### Build

Run `ng build reactome-cytoscape-style` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Publishing

After building your library with `ng build reactome-cytoscape-style`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/reactome-cytoscape-style` and run `npm publish`.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test reactome-cytoscape-style` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
